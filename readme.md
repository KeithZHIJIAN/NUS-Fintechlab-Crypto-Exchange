## NUSwap

This is NUSwap, an educational playground to uncover the mystery of the cryptocurrency market for all crypto enthusiasts. Here you can learn about the trade of cryptocurrency, and how to make money with it. 

The journey of NUSwap is a “play to learn” process. You can create your own account and learn the fundamentals of trading in the tutorial provided. At the beginning, you will be assigned with some initial assets and a short-term trading goal. As a beginner, try to achieve your goal by trading in the Lv.1 or Lv.2 beginners' markets. 

There are different levels of markets, and a higher level means to compete with higher level traders (even with trading bots) in a more volatile market. To fight against the sudden market crash and boom, and to become a better trader, you will need to apply the trade basics and strategies you learned and develop your own algorithms to protect your portofilo and profit around the clock.

There is a leaderboard showing contributors and top performing traders across different markets. Check your progress, see how close you are to your goals. Try your best to win in the market, and make your name in the community.

As an open source project, we welcome you to contribute to the project. Most importantly, we hope our player can engage in the journey of NUSwap and form a much larger community.
